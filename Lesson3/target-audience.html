     <h1>Target Audience</h1>
     <p>
       The perfect audience would be for those skeptics of the weather that love weather with a little
       bit of entertainment at the same time.  Someone who is going to check their weather forecast a
       couple times per day and maybe bookmark it.  Generally, the site would appeal to those age 18 to 50.
     <h1>Personas</h1>
       <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Michael - He's the local garbage man, works 12 hours a day and always has a keen eye to the sky.
            He's concerned that he may have to pickup trash in all of the conditions of weather and will need
            a site that has semi-reliable weather forecasting.  He's also someone who is very social and loves
            a good time.  </li>
            <li>
              Mary, a 43 year old school bus driver who has to wake up at the crack of dawn, wants to know what
              the weather is going to be for the day.  Then before her mid-day pre-school route, she checks the
              weather and again before her late afternoon route.              </li>

          
        </ul> </p>
       <h1>Scenario Concerns</h1>
       <ul>
        <li>Can I take the Corvette to get detailed?</li>
        <li>Do I need to put boots or galoshes on the children?</li>
        <li>Do I need my umbrella?</li>
        <li>What is the chance of severe weather today?</li>
        <li>Does the blizzard warning last how long?</li>
