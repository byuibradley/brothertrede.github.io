      <p><a href="https://denverpost.com" target="_new">The Denver Post</p>
      <img src="two.png" alt="The Denver Post Website Screenshot" /></a>
      <p>When we review The Denver Post, the mobile site is optimized, but when you review the main website, they run it in thirds, with main story content in column 1, links in column 2, and ads in column three.</p>

      <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
      <p><a href="https://harryanddavid.com" target="_new">Harry &amp; David</p>
      <img src="three.png" alt="Harry & David Website Screenshot" /></a>
      <p>With such a delicious website, the design changes in every block, so there is a lot of contrast.  Colors generally attach emotion, so this use is great.</p>
