                <p>
                    So you're the day dreamer.  Sitting in your office cubicle, tired of sifting through all of
                    the stacks of paperwork and just want to get away.  You want something that unleashes a little
                    bit of adventure, yet you still consider yourself a little timid.  You dedice you'd like to go
                    rafting, but have never done it before.  Our guides will spend 1-2 hours going over all of the 
                    equipment, manuevers, and safety needs.  We'll get you into the water and off we go.  As you head
                    down the river and find yourself nearing a complex rapid, your guide will coach everyone in the
                    raft as you work together.  The experience will be exilerating and enjoyable!</p>

                <H1>THE PRO - $299 per 4 hours</h1><h4><button class="bookIt" onclick="window.location.href = 'Reservations.html';">Book It</button></H4>
                <p>
                You have been in the rivers a few times and love a good rocking back and forth as the raft hits the
                rapids.  You find yourself in constant enjoyment from the constant environmental changes from calm to heavy
                rapids and back again.  You sometimes might seem that you are in over your head a little bit, but with 
                the use of our experienced guides, they will be there to coach everyone when the water gets rough.  The 
                adrenaline will be pounding and the happiness and excitment from succeeding will keep asking you for more.
                Our Pro package is just for you!

                <H1>THE VETERAN - $429 per 8 hours</H1><h4><button class="bookIt" onclick="window.location.href = 'Reservations.html';">Book It</button></H4>
                <p>
                They call you the veteran of the white water rapids.  You have been rafting tens if not hundreds of times 
                and every time you go rafting, you are expecting a little more.  While we are always cautious about water 
                levels and weather conditions, our Veteran package is a full-day adventure. While our Rookie and Pro packages
                are only half or quarter day affairs, this veteran package is not for the light hearted.  It will try your
                emotions, wear your strength, but give you the most satisfaction as you achieve 6 to 7 hours of being on the 
                water.  You will need to bring your A-Game.  We'll gladly bring an guide, but it's going to be up to you to 
                determine the team.  They will recommend aspects for safety, but you're the coach on this package! Raft on!
